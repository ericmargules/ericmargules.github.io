My professional portfolio was designed to illustrate my development, coding and design skills on an engaging and mobile-friendly website. As a [static website](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_web_page), margul.es was developed to be lightweight and easily expandable, while keeping costs to a minimum.

Margul.es was built using the [Jekyll framework](https://jekyllrb.com) and [Liquid template language](http://shopify.github.io/liquid), and deployed on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com). Margul.es features a responsive design using CSS media queries and is easily expandable thanks to Jekyll's YAML-based posting system.
