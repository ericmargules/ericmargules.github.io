My personal portfolio page. Margul.es was built using the [Jekyll framework](https://jekyllrb.com) and [Liquid template language](http://shopify.github.io/liquid), and deployed on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com). Margul.es features a responsive design using CSS media queries and is easily expandable thanks to Jekyll's YAML-based posting system.
